NalTrack Mockup Read Me
===============

## Introduction

This is a mockup of a Naloxone tracking web application. Eventually it will have proper database functionality, but for now I have added dummy values to show off the project. I used the Node framework to build this but lack a proper means of hosting it on the web, so you will need to download the files and run them locally.

## Features

  * Summarizes the data for you on the index page
  * Displays the full data if you wish to look at it

## Planned Features

  * Create records and write to JSON file (C)
  * Display/Read data from JSON file (R)
  * Update records and write to JSON file (U)
  * Delete records and write to JSON file (D)
  * Connect to MySQL database and perform CRUD functions using JavaScript requests
  * Rewrite code base to minimize duplication of methods
  * Install Node application on web to display
  * Implement testing framework using Node modules
  * Port to PHP for alternate server functionality

## Quick Installation (macOS)

  * Unzip archive file to get NalTrack folder
  * Move folder to Desktop
  * In the Finder, open the Go menu and select Applications
  * In the Applications folder, open the Utilities folder
  * In the Utilities folder, open the Terminal application
  * Enter the following command in the Terminal window: cd Desktop
  * Enter the following command in the Terminal window: npm install
